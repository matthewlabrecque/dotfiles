# dotfiles

This repository keeps my personal dotfiles and autoconfiguration scripts for all of my computers and servers. By default I use Fedora Workstation as a rock solid base, and perform the following modifications:

## Laptop autoconfiguration

My laptop configuration installs Arch Linux with the Niri scrolling window manager, and a suite of packages that I use for school. This laptop doesn't have any gaming stuff on it.

## Desktop autoconfiguration

My desktop is primarily used for gaming, so this one doesn't use a tiling window manager but instead uses default GNOME with some extensions as well as installing software such as Steam for gaming purposes. For increased performance the desktop configuration uses the CachyOS kernel for Fedora Linux.

## Server configuration

This is what I run by default on servers, be they VPS or physical hardware.
