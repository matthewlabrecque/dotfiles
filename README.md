# dotfiles

This repository keeps my personal dotfiles and autoconfiguration scripts for all of my computers and servers. By default I use Fedora Workstation as a rock solid base, and perform the following modifications:

## Laptop autoconfiguration

The laptop configuration script installs a set of packages/software that I use for school/college, and installs Niri as a window manager. No gaming software is installed on this system.

## Desktop autoconfiguration

My desktop is primarily used for gaming, so this one doesn't use a tiling window manager but instead uses default GNOME with some extensions as well as installing software such as Steam for gaming purposes. For increased performance the desktop configuration uses the CachyOS kernel for Fedora Linux.

## Server configuration

This is what I run by default on servers, be they VPS or physical hardware.
